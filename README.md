# Book management system
## Application
#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/N3GfUS-J2uE>
#### Description:
This application aids in the management of books in a library, recording and tracking the borrowing and returning of books.
The book lender needs to assign a number or id to the book and the user.
The reason I developed this application is because I thought it would be useful for my mothers' work.

   (Example: A1234567, F9204068, Z0000000, etc.)
